# WebScraperApp

The web scraper project has been created using .NET 5 and .NET Core MVC. 

It has been made with dependency injection applied and using an n-tier architecture with application, service, data-access and domain layers in an attempt to separate the concerns as best as I can.

Adjust connection string in application/appsettings.json if necessaryu then execute command “update-database” in the package manager console on the data access layer to create and populate the tables in the database then run project in visual studio.

If I had more time I would have:

- Implemented error handling such as on the web requests, database saving etc
-	Validated data on a database level as extra security
-	Added client-side validation
-	Finished learning about and applied unit testing
-	Implemented ‘chunk’ data rendering for jQuery data table to increase the scalability
-	Added extra search engines
-	Created the application as responsive
-	Formatted the line chart better such as y axis start at 0, label axes, allow for further time ranges etc

I appreciate there are gaps in my knowledge such as unit testing and a front end framework, but I am extremely keen to learn these new technologies and am highly motivated and driven. I feel I would be a great fit for the team and company if given the chance.

I hope I have done enough to proceed. However, if I haven’t it would be great to hear from you about what I could have done better.

Please let me know if there are any issues.

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you,

Daniel Wood
